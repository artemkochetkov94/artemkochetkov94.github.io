								<p>The story of Opportune is one of coworkers uniting under the realization that they have the power to improve how their industry functions, and to empower business owners.</p>
								<p>Our recruiting team has had the usual ups and downs that are standard within the industry, but early on we noticed a few problems. Our ISOs were having trouble affording recruiting services and had no idea where to find good sales people and support staff on their own. Then, they didn't have the time to fully train their new recruits.</p>
								<p>One day, we were sitting around discussing these issues, and...</p>
								<p>OMG!!!</p>
								<p>We realized that we could provide a simple yet robust, cost-effective solution! With combined experience including sales, staffing agency management, start-up consultation, and various roles within merchant services, we perceived that creating a specialized industry firm with custom recruiting, training, and pricing options would solve this problem plaguing our industry!</p>
								<p>We are excited to be launching this revolutionary recruiting group, and we look forward to helping our clients scale up!</p>
